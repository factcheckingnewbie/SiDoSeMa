# SiDoSema: SimpleDockerSesssionManager
###  Simply stated: run docker-apps with snapshotting through CIRU.
Support multipile profiles and Multiple instances even for apps that per design only can be run in one instance.

### This is a spinoff from my docker based firefox manager, and i for the moment mainly focused on my coming Konsole manager. I will implement support for both in the near future.

##### I push firefox manager later, as I now are in the moddle of the development for the konsole manager.

This app will have per-app managed orhestration. And there will be one main app that shalll be able to orchester the orchestatrions.
