## Proect Layout
1. **I have decided to:**
  * *name my buildscripts for container to buildcontainer.sh*
  * *name my scripts for launch container to runcontainer.sh*
  * *if there are more than one script needed to  launch the container, there wil be either
    * runcontaineer-\<purpose>.sh
    * or      
    * \<purpose>.sh which will launch runcontainer.sh with argument

* Doccumentation. Directory naming, Markdown documents  and the code itslf.
